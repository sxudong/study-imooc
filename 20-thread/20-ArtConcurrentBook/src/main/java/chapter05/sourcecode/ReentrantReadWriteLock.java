/**
 * ReentrantReadWriteLock 读写锁源码
 * https://blog.51cto.com/14220760/2394230
 *
 * ReentrantReadWriteLock读写锁，要想学习好这个类，就必须了解什么是读锁，什么是写锁，
 * 怎么区别读锁和写锁，因为我们都知道锁都是通过AQS的state来控制的，但是现在是两个锁，
 * 所以理解ReentrantReadWriteLock对state拆分的运算很重要，也就是二进制的低16位是写锁，
 * 高16位是读锁，也不得不说大神设计让人叹为观止啊；还有就是理解读写锁的一些特性，重入指
 * 的就是同一个线程获取锁之后，再次调用lock方法不会被阻塞，但是注意调用几次lock，就要
 * 调用几次unlock，因为我们通过源码得知重入其实就是对state的累加，还有就是锁降级，我个
 * 人更愿意理解为特殊的重入，锁降级就是一个线程先获得写锁，然后这个线程再去获取读锁，这
 * 样不会阻塞，然后写锁其实就降级为了读锁，然后在释放写锁，最后释放读锁，作者为什么这么
 * 设计了，书上说的，锁降级主要是为了保证数据的可见性，如果当前线程不获取读锁而是直接释
 * 放写锁，假设此刻另一个线程（记作线程T）获取了写锁并修改了数据，那么当前线程无法感知
 * 线程T的数据更新，如果当前线程获取读锁，即遵循锁降级的步骤，则线程T,就会阻塞，直到当
 * 前线程使用数据并释放读锁之后，线程T才会获得写锁并更新数据。个人理解这个锁降级其实是
 * 一种特殊的锁的优化策略，在我们需要在边写边读的这种业务场景中，保证数据可见性的同时
 * （不让其他线程获取写锁），提升本线程读锁性能，因为不需要和写锁或者其他读锁（公平锁）
 * 去竞争获取锁，而是直接降级为读锁。
